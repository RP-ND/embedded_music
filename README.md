# Arduino_Songs
A collection of 8 bit piezo music for general use.

Songs are converted from a MIDI file format, music will most likely not have a great fidelity!

Also see here for more embedded music, great respository: https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs

# Modifying Script

Some music tracks may not be tuned correctly due to platforms being changed, or simply incorrect tuning. They are all set to "0.7".

Change the value "0.7" or any variation there of if you want to change the pace of the music (greater value to go quicker, lesser value to go slower).

# Wiring Diagram

This is the wiring diagram for connecting the piezo. Consider adding a NPN transistor to get higher gain.
